Role: You are an expert Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) specialist and Front-end Developer experienced in Affiliate Marketing for the Nigerian (NG) market.

Task: I need you to modify the attached index.html file. This is a pre-lander for an MTN offer. Currently, the page promises "Free Rewards," but the actual offer landing page requires users to subscribe to a "Daily Plan" for N100 to play. I need to bridge this gap to reduce the bounce rate. The goal is to pre-frame the user so they expect the small N100 fee and view it as a high-value entry ticket, rather than being surprised by a charge.

Please implement the following specific changes to the code:

1. Header & Branding (Align with Offer Page):

Change the page <title> and the <h1> in the header from "MTN Daily Lucky Draw" to "MTN Scratch & Play - Daily Jackpot".

This aligns with the actual product name on the offer page.

2. Alert Banner (Set Expectations):

Update the .alert-banner text.

From: "Limited Time: Win ₦5000 Daily!"

To: "🔥 Live: Win Cash & Airtime with Daily Plan!"

Design tweak: Change the banner background gradient to a darker red (linear-gradient(135deg, #b91c1c 0%, #dc2626 100%)) to match the "Try your Luck" banner on the offer page.

3. Body Copy (The "Small Investment" Angle):

Update the .client section text:

Change "You've been selected for MTN Scratch & Play!" to "You've been selected for the Daily Winners Club! Unlock your chance to turn ₦100 into ₦50,000 instantly!"

Update the .info section headline:

Change "Find Hidden ₦5000 Prize!" to "Match the Items to Win!" (This matches the game mechanics shown on the offer page).

4. Social Proof (Nigeria Context & Objection Handling):

Rewrite the 3 comments in the .comments section to sound like authentic Nigerian users (using slight Pidgin/local English) who are validating the N100 cost and SMS verification.

Comment 1 (Chioma): "I was skeptical about the N100 daily plan at first, but I tried it and BOOM! Won ₦2000 airtime immediately. Legit! 🇳🇬"

Comment 2 (Tunde): "Just subscribed. The code arrived fast via SMS. Hoping to hit the cash jackpot today! Abeg make una wish me luck o!"

Comment 3 (Zainab): "My friend won yesterday so I joined via the daily plan. Best way to verify is to use your main MTN line."

5. Javascript Popups (The Call to Action):

Modify dialog3 function (The Winner Popup):

Do not just say "You won". Instead, say "Match Found! Prize Reserved."

Update the html content in the Swal.fire to explicitly instruct the user on the next steps.

New HTML content for popup:

HTML

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <h3 style="color: #000;">🎉 MATCH FOUND! 🎉</h3>
    <p>You have matched the winning items!</p>
    <div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px dashed #ffcc00; margin: 10px 0;">
        <strong>YOUR PRIZE: ₦5000 Cash/Airtime</strong><br>
        <span style="color: #dc3545; font-size: 0.9em;">Status: Pending Activation</span>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Final Step to Claim:</strong></p>
    <ol style="text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; display: inline-block;">
        <li>Click <strong>"CLAIM NOW"</strong> below.</li>
        <li>Enter your MTN number on the next page.</li>
        <li>Subscribe to the <strong>N100 Daily Plan</strong> to unlock your prize wallet!</li>
    </ol>
</div>
Change button text to: "CLAIM NOW ➤"

Modify dialog3Manual function:

Update the HTML to reinforce the "Official MTN Partner Site" and "N100 Daily Plan activation" instructions.

Output: Please provide the full, updated index.html file with all these changes implemented, ensuring the layout remains responsive and the game logic still works.
